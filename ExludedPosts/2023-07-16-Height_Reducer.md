<div class="col-md-6">
In the case where the player is crouched under an object, this module is responsible for updating the parameters of the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CharacterController.html" target="_blank">CharacterController</a> component provided by Unity, which will be attached to the <strong>FPEC</strong>. This prevents the player from passing through the object above when they stop crouching.
