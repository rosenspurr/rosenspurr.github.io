The main purpose of this module was to provide a solution to the challenge of holding objects, weapons, or items in front of the camera, avoiding them from passing through walls or other elements. This is known as "clipping." Through this development, I was able to put into practice the basic concepts learned during the IPOO (Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming) course at the National University of the South, and begin exploring the implementation of object-oriented programming in a real-world environment like Unity.
